abstract: Load balancing is the process of improving the performance of the system by sharing of workload among the processors. The workload of a machine means the total processing time it requires to execute all the tasks assigned to it. Load balancing is one of the important factors to heighten the working performance of the cloud service provider. The benefits of distributing the workload include increased resource utilization ratio which further leads to enhancing the overall performance thereby achieving maximum client satisfaction. In this paper, we are demonstrating the use of the singleton model for load balancing.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: In this paper, we present an implementation to do load balancing in heterogeneous distributed systems using a singleton model by making use of simple technologies provided by Java Programming language. The ObjectOriented concepts in Java enable us to invoke any POJO containing the Business logic of an Application from the RMI Server program without editing the code.
